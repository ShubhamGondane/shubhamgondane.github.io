I am a graduate student at Arizona State University. My research interests are Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing and Big Data.

Research 
------
I have successfully defended my thesis on "Analysis of Tweets for Social Media Health Applications" on November 5th. My thesis focuses on use of Language Models like BERT and transfer learning techniques. I have worked on the following 3 tasks in my thesis

1. Generalizable System to identify personal health experience mentions in tweets.
2. Automatic classification of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) mentions in tweets.
3. Extraction of ADRs from tweets.

* Developed a generalizable system using BERT a language model to identify personal health experience mention in tweets across different health domains. The system came in second out of 19 submissions at SMM4H workshop at ACL 2019 conference. 

* Developed a deep learning system using language models and transfer learning to automatically classify and perform named entity extraction of adverse drug reaction mention in tweets.

Apart from my thesis I have also worked on another research project in the intersection of social media and higher education. 

The research paper titled "The Impact of Impression Management on Academic Program Reputations: An analysis of Engineering Colleges" has been accepted at AERA 2020.

Generalizable systems for social media health mining
--------------

This is my main research focus and is a part of my ongoing thesis towards building generalizable machine learning systems. The idea is to build ML systems that can work across different domains and also on future data. The area where I am working is using Twitter data to identify personal health related tweets.

Around 500 million tweets are posted every day according to recent estimates. Such a vast data source has provided researchers a way to study public health. Numerous studies have been done in this social media health mining area ranging across pharmacovigilance, tracking spread of infectious diseases like flu and zika virus, identifying drug abuse circles and discussions on public health topics. 

To accurately analyze public health, it is important to identify tweets mentioning a personal health experience. This has proven to be a challenging task mainly because of the short length of tweets, the inventive spellings and creative language expressions. Another important limitation is the use of disease specific model and dataset to study a particular disease in a particular domain. 

Basically the questions that I am trying to answer is: 
How good can a system generalize if we train a model on flu related tweets and test it on another disease domain and how can we improve that? Can we make domain independent classifiers? Transfer Learning is one of the promising techniques in deep learning were in you can fine-tune a model that is trained on huge corpus on your smaller corpus. Even transfer learning is not a perfect solution and often times a hybrid approach can give better results. I am using transfer learning as the starting point of my system in this thesis and I am trying to improve it even further.

I had submitted my system to the Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) Workshop & Shared Task 2019
